This simulator is still under development.

I keep my development diary in repo of [Transition-to-C17](https://github.com/Shihao-Song/Transition-to-C17)

We are using Google Protocol Buffers to store small CPU traces, so please install [the latest release](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf). For large CPU traces, we still use normal TXT file.

Please also install the latest c++ boost library.

## Congratulations! Accepted papers that use our simulator
